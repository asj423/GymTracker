# 🏋️ TrackMate — Gym Tracking App

**TrackMate** is a desktop app built with **PySide6 (Qt)** and **SQLite** that helps users log workouts, track bodyweight, and stay motivated through progress graphs and goal setting.

This was a university group project for the Programming 1 (CM10025), following SCRUM methodology across two sprints.

## 🧠 My Contribution

I was Progress and data visualisation leader and was first and foremost responsible for the **graph design** and **backend logic**, including:

- Creating the graphs that show user's data against time
- Making sure it linked with the database so that the information shown is up to date  
- Defensive programming to catch and prevent invalid inputs  
- Integrating progress functionality with PySide6 GUI components
