# 🏋️ TrackMate — Gym Tracking App

**TrackMate** is a desktop app built with **PySide6 (Qt)** and **SQLite** that helps users log workouts, track bodyweight, and stay motivated through progress graphs and goal setting.

This was a university group project for the Programming 1 (CM10025), following SCRUM methodology across two sprints.

## 🧠 My Contribution

I was back-end team leader and was first and foremost responsible for the **database design** and **backend logic**, including:

- Creating the workout and bodyweight logging system  
- Validating and storing user data securely  
- Future proofing the database for our future concepts 
- Defensive programming to catch and prevent invalid inputs  
- Integrating database functionality with PySide6 GUI components  

The database followed professional design principles (normalization, foreign keys, referential integrity) and was built with extensibility in mind (e.g. multi-user support, RPE tracking).
